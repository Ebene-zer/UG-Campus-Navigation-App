#  UG Campus Navigation App

A Java-based application that helps users find the **best routes** across the University of Ghana campus.  
The app calculates **shortest paths**, considers **landmarks**, and supports multiple algorithms for routing, sorting, and searching.

##  Features
- 🚶 Find shortest and most optimal routes between two locations
- 🏛️ Filter routes by landmarks (banks, lecture halls, hostels, etc.)
- ⏱️ Sort routes by distance or estimated travel time
- 📊 Uses multiple algorithms:
  - **Routing**: Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Vogel Approximation, Northwest Corner Method, Critical Path Method
  - **Sorting**: Quick Sort, Merge Sort
  - **Searching**: Binary Search, Linear Search
- 🖥️ Java Swing-based GUI

##  Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core + Swing GUI)
- **Graph Data Structures** (Adjacency List / Matrix)
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Divide & Conquer**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
